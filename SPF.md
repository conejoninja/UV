SKIN TYPES
==========

Learn more about the [Fitzpatrick scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale)

* Type I (scores 0-7) Light, pale white. Always burns, never tans
* Type II (scores 8-16) White; fair. Usually burns, tans with difficulty
* Type III (scores 17-24) Medium, white to olive. Sometimes mild burn, gradually tans to olive.
* Type IV (scores 25-30) Olive, moderate brown. Rarely burns, tans with ease to a moderate brown.
* Type V (scores over 30) Brown, dark brown. Very rarely burns, tans very easily
* Type VI Black, very dark brown to black. Never burns, tans very easily, deeply pigmented.

In case of doubt, use a lower type of skin to be sure.


TIME OF EXPOSURE (without sunscreen)
================

Base time

* Skin Type I: 67 min
* Skin Type II: 100 min
* Skin Type III: 200 min
* Skin Type IV: 300 min
* Skin Type V: 400 min
* Skin Type VI: 500 min

Maximum time of exposure = SPF * Base time / UV Index

SPF of the sunscreen increase the time of safe sun exposure. Some modifiers has to be applied to the UV Index (UVI) for altitude (+16% each 1000m above sea level) and reflections of snow (+85%), water (+50%), sand (+20%), grass (+20%),...


EXAMPLE
=======
* Altitude: 3000m (+48%)
* Snow: (+85%)
* UV Index: 10
* Skin Type: III
* SPF: 45


UVI: 10 * 1.48 (altitude) * 1.85 (snow) ~= 27 (real value is 27.38, but I always saw UVI as an integer)


Maximum time (without sunscreen) = 200/27 = 7.4 minutes


Maximum time (SPF 45) = 45*200/27 = 333.3 minutes
